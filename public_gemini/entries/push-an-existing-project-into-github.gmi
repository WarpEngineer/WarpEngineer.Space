I always forget these steps so noting them here. This does assume that an empty repo is first created on GitHub.

* git init # initialize directory to be a new git repo
* git add . # add files
* git commit -m "Initial Commit" # commit the files
* git remote add origin  # add the GitHub repo as the remote
* git remote -v # verify addition
* git push origin master # push commit to master branch on GitHub
