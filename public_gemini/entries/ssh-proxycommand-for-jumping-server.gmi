## Getting to a server behind a firewall

Machine A can get to Machine B

Machine B can get to Machine C

Machine A **CAN NOT** get to Machine C directly.

Most people will use SSH to connect from Machine A to Machine B, then use SSH again to connect from Machine B to Machine C.

### Another option: ProxyCommand

Add the following to SSH config

```cfg
Host hostb
    User myself
    Hostname machineB
    	
Host hostc
    User myself
    Hostname machineC
    Port 22
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p hostb
```

With this configuration, SSH can be used to connect directly from Machine A to Machine C.  SSH will automatically direct the connection through Machine B.

```
	
```
