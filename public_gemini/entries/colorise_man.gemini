# Add Some Color to Man Pages

I was looking through my .bashrc and came across this.  I've been using it so long that I had forgotten that colorized Man pages aren't usually the default. I can't remember where I found it.

## Add some color to your man pages.


``` man color function
man() {
    LESS_TERMCAP_md=$'\e[01;31m' \
    LESS_TERMCAP_me=$'\e[0m' \
    LESS_TERMCAP_us=$'\e[01;32m' \
    LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$'\e[0m' \
    LESS_TERMCAP_so=$'\e[45;93m' \
    LESS_TERMCAP_se=$'\e[0m' \
    command man "$@"
}
```
