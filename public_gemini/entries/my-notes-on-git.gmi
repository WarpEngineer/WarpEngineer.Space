## Stuff I keep forgetting

### Work on a remote branch

1. `git fetch <origin> <remote_branch>`
2. `git checkout -b <local_branch_name> <origin>/<remote_branch>`

 1. can also be: `git checkout <remote_branch>`

### Track a remote branch

1. `git checkout -b <local_branch> # if no local created yet`
2. `git branch -u <origin>/<remote_branch>`

##### Will update this as needed.
