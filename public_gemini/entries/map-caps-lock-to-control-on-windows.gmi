Caps Lock is not very useful for developers. Turn Caps Lock into another Ctrl key on Windows with a simple Registry hack.

```html

To map the Caps Lock key to Ctrl, create a file in Notepad and save it with the `.reg` extension.  The contents of the file should be one of the two options below.  Double click the file to make the Registry updates.  Most likely either a logout/login or a reboot will be needed for the changes to take effect.
